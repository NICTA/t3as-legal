Additional files to satisfy legal requirements

Our legal advice is that to satisfy AGPL clause 13, we need to provide source code for all our transitive dependencies (even though sbt can download them for you).

If you are a developer, we suggest that you head over to the project repos [t3as-pdf](https://github.com/NICTA/t3as-pdf) and [t3as-redact](https://github.com/NICTA/t3as-redact) instead.
